# VibeConnect: Project Overview

## Project Vision

VibeConnect is a social networking platform designed to connect people through shared interests, groups, and events. The core idea is to create a community where users can:

*   **Build a Profile**: Create a personal profile to showcase their personality, hobbies, and passions.
*   **Connect with Others**: Find and connect with like-minded individuals.
*   **Create and Join Groups**: Form or become a part of groups centered around specific interests.
*   **Discover and Host Events**: Find out about or organize events, either within groups or as standalone activities.

Essentially, VibeConnect aims to be a space where people can foster connections and build communities around the things they love to do.

## Core Features

To achieve this vision, the app is planned to have the following features:

*   **User Authentication**: Secure sign-up and sign-in, including options for social logins (Google, Facebook, etc.).
*   **Rich User Profiles**: Customizable profiles with pictures, bios, status messages, and personal interests.
*   **Connections**: The ability to send, accept, and manage connection requests.
*   **Groups**: Functionality for users to create, join, and manage public or private groups.
*   **Events**: Tools to create, find, and attend events.
*   **Interactive Home Feed**: A central dashboard to see updates on events, group activities, and status messages from connections.
*   **Real-time Chat**: One-on-one instant messaging.
*   **Notifications**: Alerts for important activities like connection requests or group invites.
